      <p class="intro-weather">
        Ayurveda teaches us that we do not exist in isolation from the natural
        world, but as an integral part of it, relying on it for our health and
        well-being. Our bodies are influenced by everything around us and in
        turn influence the way we relate to nature, the environment where we
        live, everything we touch, see, eat, or feel. Similarly, our body also
        gets affected by the various seasons and the changes occurring in them.
